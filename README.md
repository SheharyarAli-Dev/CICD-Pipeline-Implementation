# CI/CD Pipeline Implementation — GitHub Actions
### SCD Assignment 2 | CLO 4

> Automating the full software development lifecycle using GitHub Actions — from code integration and deployment to dependency management, code review, and documentation publishing.

---

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive **CI/CD pipeline** built on top of the [Heavens Above](https://github.com/stevenjoezhang/heavens-above) Node.js project. It implements **7 GitHub Actions workflows** covering every major phase of a modern development lifecycle — continuous integration, automated deployment, scheduled maintenance, dependency monitoring, code quality enforcement, documentation publishing, and custom release automation.

## Workflows

### 1. Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)
**Trigger:** Every push to `main` branch, or manually via `workflow_dispatch`

Runs automated checks to ensure every code change meets quality standards before it is merged.

**Steps:**
- Checks out code
- Sets up Node.js 20
- Installs dependencies via `npm install`
- Runs linting and saves output to `lint-report.txt`
- Runs tests and saves output to `test-report.txt`
- Uploads both reports as downloadable artifacts

**How to interpret results:** Green check = all checks passed. If the workflow fails, download the `lint-results` or `test-results` artifact from the Actions tab for details.

---

### 2. Deployment Pipeline (`deploy.yml`)
**Trigger:** Every push to `main` branch

Automates deployment of the application to **Vercel** on every successful push to main.

**Steps:**
- Checks out the repository
- Deploys to Vercel using the `amondnet/vercel-action` with production flags (`--prod --yes`)

**Required Secrets:**
| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | Your Vercel API token |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | Your Vercel organization ID |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | Your Vercel project ID |

---

### 3. Scheduled Tasks (`scheduled-tasks.yml`)
**Trigger:** Daily at midnight UTC (`0 0 * * *`), or manually

Runs routine maintenance tasks automatically on a schedule.

**Steps:**
- Checks out the repository
- Sets up Node.js 20
- Executes maintenance script (logs date, runs backup simulation)
- Sends a notification on completion (extensible to Slack/Discord/Email)

**How to interpret results:** Check the Actions tab for daily run logs. Extend the `Run scheduled maintenance script` step with your actual backup or cleanup commands.

---

### 4. Dependency Updates (`dependency-updates.yml` + `dependabot.yml`)
**Trigger:** Every Sunday at midnight UTC, or manually

Monitors and updates npm dependencies automatically, then opens a Pull Request for review.

**Steps:**
- Checks out code
- Installs current dependencies
- Runs `npm outdated` to list stale packages
- Runs `npm update` to apply updates
- Executes tests to verify compatibility
- Opens a PR titled **"Automated Dependency Updates"** to `main`

**Dependabot Configuration:** Also configured via `.github/dependabot.yml` to:
- Monitor `npm` packages weekly
- Monitor `github-actions` weekly
- Auto-label PRs with `dependencies` and `automated-update`
- Assign reviewer `Sheharyar171`

---

### 5. Code Review (`code-review.yml`)
**Trigger:** Pull requests to `main`, pushes to `main`, or manually

Enforces coding standards and security before any code is merged.

**Steps:**
- Checks out code
- Installs dependencies
- Runs ESLint (linting) — reports pass/fail
- Runs test suite — reports pass/fail
- Runs `npm audit` for security vulnerability scanning (moderate severity threshold)

**How to interpret results:** Each step reports ✅ or ⚠️ in the log. The security audit step will flag any known CVEs in dependencies.

---

### 6. Documentation Deployment (`documentation-deploy.yml`)
**Trigger:** Push to `main` when files in `docs/` are changed, or manually

Automatically builds and publishes project documentation to **GitHub Pages**.

**Steps:**
- Checks out the repository
- Installs dependencies
- Copies all files from `docs/` into `docs-build/`
- Deploys `docs-build/` to GitHub Pages using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`

**Note:** Create a `docs/` folder at the root of the project and add your Markdown or HTML documentation files. They will be automatically published on every update.

---

### 7. Custom Workflow — Release Notes Generator (`custom-workflow.yml`)
**Trigger:** When a version tag matching `v*.*.*` is pushed, or manually

Automates generation of release notes whenever a new version is tagged.

**Steps:**
- Checks out the repository
- Sets up Node.js 20
- Installs dependencies
- Generates a `notes.txt` file inside `release-notes/` with the tag reference
- Commits and force-pushes to a dedicated `release-notes` branch
- Sends a notification confirming the release notes were generated

**Usage:**
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
